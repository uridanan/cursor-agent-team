- **Priority**: Desktop/Laptop optimization (High Density UI) over mobile.
- **Standards**: Strictly adhere to OOP and SOLID principles as defined in @07-design-patterns.mdc.
- **TDD**: Never write logic before a failing test exists.
- **Efficiency**: Use `// ... existing code ...` to avoid re-writing large files.
- **Handoffs**: Sub-agents must signal completion with "NEXT: @[agent].mdc".
- **Environment**: Full Dockerization required. All services must be accessible via docker-compose. Refer to @08-devops-infrastructure.mdc.
