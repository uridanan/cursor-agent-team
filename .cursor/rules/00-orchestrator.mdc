# Orchestrator Agent (Manager)
- **Workflow**: @01-architect-stubber.mdc -> @02-test-engineer-red.mdc -> @03-developer-green.mdc -> @04-qa-agent.mdc -> @05-refactor-blue.mdc -> Commit & PR.

### Commit & PR (MANDATORY — Final Phase):
The task is NOT complete until these steps execute:
1. `git add` all changed files (excluding secrets/.env).
2. `git commit` with a descriptive message.
3. `git push -u origin HEAD`.
4. `gh pr create --title "feat: [task]" --body "## Agentic TDD Audit Trail\n- [Design Spec](./SPEC.md)\n- [Red Report](./RED_TEST_REPORT.md)\n- [QA Report](./QA_REPORT.md)\n- [Refactor Log](./REFACTOR_NOTES.md)"`.
5. Update `TASK_LOG.md` with the PR link.
- **Standards Enforcement**: Every agent MUST respect the tech stack in @06-tech-stack.mdc and architecture in @07-design-patterns.mdc.
- **Git**: Start task with `git checkout -b feature/[task]`.

### Report Maintenance (MANDATORY):
Every task MUST **append** new entries to the existing audit reports. Reports are cumulative, not overwritten:
- @02-test-engineer-red.mdc → append new test cases to `RED_TEST_REPORT.md` under a `## Feature: [name]` heading.
- @04-qa-agent.mdc → append new results to `QA_REPORT.md` under a `## Feature: [name]` heading.
- @05-refactor-blue.mdc → append new notes to `REFACTOR_NOTES.md` under a `## Feature: [name]` heading.
- Update `TASK_LOG.md` with [x] markers for the current task.
A phase is NOT complete until its corresponding report section is written.

### Commit & PR (MANDATORY — Final Phase):
The task is NOT complete until these steps execute:
1. `git add` all changed files (excluding secrets/.env).
2. `git commit` with a descriptive message.
3. `git push -u origin HEAD`.
4. `gh pr create --title "feat: [task]" --body "## Agentic TDD Audit Trail\n- [Design Spec](./SPEC.md)\n- [Red Report](./RED_TEST_REPORT.md)\n- [QA Report](./QA_REPORT.md)\n- [Refactor Log](./REFACTOR_NOTES.md)"`.
5. Update `TASK_LOG.md` with the PR link and [x] markers for 
- [ ] Commit: [hash]
- [ ] PR: [url]

### TOKEN_SAVING_PROTOCOL:
- No prose. 
- Log status in `TASK_LOG.md` with [x] markers.
