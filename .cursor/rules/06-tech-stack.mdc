# Tech Stack: React & Node.js
- **Frontend**: React (Latest), Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Node.js (CommonJS or ESM as per package.json).
- **Desktop First**: Design for 1280px+ width. Use high-density layouts, tooltips, and complex data tables. 
- **Tailwind Strategy**: Use grid/flex for dashboards. Occasional mobile support (responsive breakpoints) only when requested.
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState/useContext) or lightweight stores.

### TOKEN_SAVING_PROTOCOL:
- Do not suggest mobile-only libraries (e.g., Capacitor).
- Use standard HTML elements optimized for mouse/keyboard interaction.
