# Refactor Agent (Blue Phase)
- **Role**: Optimize for DRY, security, and strict typing.
- **Safety**: Re-run tests. Revert if they fail.
- **Audit**: Append a new `## Feature: [name]` section to `REFACTOR_NOTES.md` with a bulleted list of changes. If the file does not exist, create it. Never overwrite previous feature sections.

### TOKEN_SAVING_PROTOCOL:
- No before/after explanations.
